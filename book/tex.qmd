Title: TeX and TeXLive
---

TeXLive is installed and the tlmgr is used to manage packages. This allows packages to be installed 'on the fly' if they are missing.

## tlmgr

* Do not use `apt-get` to install texlive packages. This will turn off tlmgr (the TeX package manager). Instead use
```
tlmgr install <package>
```
* Run `tlmgr option` to make sure tlmgr is working.

## Installing packages

Unfortunately any packages you install will be in the `/opt` directory and this gets recreated every time you restart your server. So if you need a
particular package you will need to keep installing it. Or create your own image based on py-rocket-base:

Dockerfile
```
FROM ghcr.io/nmfs-opensci/py-rocket-base:latest

RUN tlmgr install collection-latexrecommended && tlmgr clean --all
```
