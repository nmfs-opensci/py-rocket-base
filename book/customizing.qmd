Title: Customizing py-rocket-base
---

py-rocket-base is designed to be used in the FROM line of a Dockerfile. It behaves like repo2docker in that it looks for special files and will 
install Python package or R packages if those special files are present. If you don't want it to do this then do not name your files one of these names:

- environment.yml
- install.R
- postBuild
- apt.txt
