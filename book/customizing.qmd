# Using py-rocket-base

py-rocket-base is designed to be used in the FROM line of a Dockerfile. It behaves like repo2docker in that it looks for special files and will 
install Python package or R packages if those special files are present. You do not need to add anything to the Dockerfile to have it process these files. py-rocker-base does this automatically for you.

If you don't want it to do this then do not name your files one of these names:

- environment.yml
- install.R
- postBuild
- apt.txt
- start

## File structure

Only Dockerfile is required. The rest are optional. 

```
your-repo/
├── Dockerfile
├── apt.txt
├── environment.yml
├── install.R
├── postBuild
├── start
├── Desktop/
│   ├── qgis.desktop
│   ├── qgis.xml
│   └── qgis.png
```

Read [configuration_files](configuration_files.html) to learn about apt.txt, environment.yml, install.R, postBuild, and start. Read [Desktop](desktop.html) to learn about the Desktop folder and files for applications.

## Examples

You want to add some Python packages to py-rocker-base.
