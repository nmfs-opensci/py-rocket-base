# Desktop

py-rocket-base includes the [xfce4 Desktop UI](https://www.xfce.org/) where you can run applications. A common application is to run QGIS or java-based applications. py-rocket-base
looks for files with the ending `.desktop`, `.xml` (optional), and `.png` (optional) associated with an application in a directory called Desktop in your repo.

To add new desktop applications[^1], you add a `.desktop` file to `${HOME}/.local/share/applications/`. To have an icon on the Desktop, you create a folder Desktop in the `${HOME}` and create a soft link to the `.desktop` files in `${HOME}/.local/share/applications/`. py-rocket-base does this automatically (via a start script) so that the user only has to put files into a Desktop directory in the docker build repo.

```

## .desktop

Example `.desktop` file is a configuration file that describes how an application is launched. The required parts are Name, Exec and Type. MimeType specifies what types of files the application can use (optional).

```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=CWUtils
GenericName=CoastWatch Data Analysis Tool
Icon=/srv/repo/Desktop/cdat.png
TryExec=cdat
Exec=cdat %F
Terminal=false
StartupNotify=false
Categories=Qt;Education;Science;Geography;
Keywords=map;globe;
```

## .xml

You can specify the mime types via xml.

## .png

You can include a png for the icon. py-rocket-base will place this in `/srv/repo/Desktop/` so use a location like `/srv/repo/Desktop/my.png` for your png that you include in your Desktop folder.
