# Desktop

py-rocket-base includes the [xfce4 Desktop UI](https://www.xfce.org/) where you can run applications. It is built off [freedesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/) (which is helpful to know if you are debugging and configuring). A common application is to run QGIS or java-based applications. py-rocket-base
looks for files with the ending `.desktop`, `.xml` (optional), and `.png` or `.svg` (optional) associated with an application in a directory called Desktop in your repo. 

py-rocket-base puts these `.desktop` files in `/usr/share/Desktop`. Typically these desktop files are in `~/Desktop`. But in a JupyterHub, the home directory is often persistent and py-rocket-base tries not to alter the user home directory. Also there might be orphaned desktop files in `~/Desktop` and so the user desktop UI would be inconsistent between users. Using `/usr/share/Desktop` does mean that users cannot add their own persistent applications to xfce4 Desktop but this would be difficult anyhow without root access in many cases.


## Adding an application in your child docker image

Use the pyrocket script `install-desktop.sh` to set up the desktop and move your files to the proper location. Provide a path to a directory with your Desktop files as the argument to the script. Here is the code for your Docker file. This script must be run as root. 

```
USER root
COPY ./Desktop /tmp/Desktop
RUN /pyrocket_scripts/install-desktop.sh  /tmp/Desktop
RUN rm -rf /tmp/Desktop
USER ${NB_USER}
```

### Create the Desktop directory

Create the directory and add the .desktop and optional .png and .xml files. py-rocket-base will move them to the correct places (`/usr/share/applications` and `/usr/share/Desktop`, `/usr/share/mime/packages` and icon locations).

```
your-repo/
├── Dockerfile
├── optional extra files
├── Desktop/
│   ├── qgis.desktop
│   ├── qgis.xml
│   └── qgis.png
```


#### .desktop file

The `.desktop` file is a configuration file that describes how an application is launched. The required parts are Name, Exec and Type. MimeType specifies what types of files the application can use (optional).

cdat.desktop
```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=CWUtils
GenericName=CoastWatch Data Analysis Tool
Icon=/srv/repo/Desktop/cdat.png
TryExec=cdat
Exec=cdat %F
Terminal=false
StartupNotify=false
Categories=Qt;Education;Science;Geography;
Keywords=map;globe;
```

#### .xml

You can specify the mime types via xml.

#### icons

You can include a png or svg for the icon. py-rocket-base will place this in `/usr/share/icons/hicolor`. If you put your icon file in the Desktop directory in your repo, then in your desktop file, use the file name without the extension. If for some reason, your icon is not showing up, use the direct url `/srv/repo/Desktop/your-icon-name.png`. If the icon cache does not update properly, you have the use the full url.

```
Icon=cdat
```

You can also use an absolute file path.

If an icon is installed with your application, it will be in the installation files.
```
Icon=/srv/conda/envs/notebook/share/qgis/images/icons/qgis-icon-512x512.png
```
or if you include an icon in your `Desktop` directory, it will be in `/srv/repo/Desktop`.
```
Icon=/srv/repo/Desktop/cdat.png
```


### Install the application

How you install the application really varies. Here are 2 examples.

**QGIS**

* add `qgis` to `environment.yml`
* add `libgl1-mesa-glx` to `apt.txt`
* add the .desktop file to Desktop directory

qgis.desktop
```

```

**CoastWatch Utilities**

Add this to the docker file to install
```
USER root
# Install cwutils
RUN cd /tmp && \
    wget https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/coastwatch/cwf/cwutils-4_0_0_198-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && \
    tar -zxf cwutils-4_0_0_198-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && \
    rm -rf cwutils-4_0_0_198-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
ENV PATH=${PATH}:/tmp/cwutils_4.0.0.198/bin
ENV MANPATH=${MANPATH}:/tmp/cwutils_4.0.0.198/doc/man
ENV INSTALL4J ADD VM PARAMS=-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2.0
USER ${NB_USER}
```

Add this `cdat.desktop` file to Desktop directory
```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=CWUtils
GenericName=CoastWatch Data Analysis Tool
Icon=/srv/repo/Desktop/cdat.png
TryExec=cdat
Exec=cdat %F
Terminal=false
StartupNotify=false
Categories=Qt;Education;Science;Geography;
Keywords=map;globe;
```

Add `cdat.png` icon to Desktop directory.

## What's happening

To add new desktop applications, one needs to do the following. py-rocket-base does these steps automatically (via the start script) so that the user only has to put files into a Desktop directory in the docker build repo.

* Install the application. See examples.
* Add a `.desktop` file to an application directory. py-rocket-base puts these in `/usr/share/applications` but you will also see `${HOME}/.local/share/applications/`. 
* To have an icon on the Desktop, you create a folder Desktop and tell XDG what directory to use. The directory is specified in `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` which XDG sets. By default (XDG), this folder is `~/Desktop` but you can set it to something else. py-rocket-base sets a default value in `/etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults`. This updates `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` when the `/etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc` start script is run (when the `/desktop` button is clicked).
* XDG looks for .desktop files in the Desktop directory. py-rocket-base creates a soft link to the `.desktop` files in `/usr/share/applications/` in `/usr/share/Desktop`.
