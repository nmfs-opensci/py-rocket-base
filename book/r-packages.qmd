# R packages

To install extra R packages, use `install.R`. This is treated as an R script which is run.  For example, you can have a script like

install.R
```markdown
repo <- "https://p3m.dev/cran/__linux__/jammy/2024-05-13"
list.of.packages <- c("ggplot2","remotes")
install.packages(list.of.packages, repos=repo)
remotes::install_github("hadley/httr@v0.4")
```

### Spatial libraries

Some packages depend on linux packages. One example are spatial packages like `sf` which depend on GDAL. In this case
```markdown
install.packages("sf")
```
will not work because it will not install the linux package dependencies.

There are a few ways to get around this.

* Install the necessary linux packages via apt-get. This can be hard.
* Install via via /rocker_scipts/install_geospatial.sh
  To do this include
  ```markdown
  RUN /rocker_scipts/install_geospatial.sh
  ```
  in your Dockerfile.
* Use r2u which has Ubuntu binaries with all the dependencies included.

### Default CRAN repository

The default CRAN repository is set in `${R_HOME}/etc/Rprofile.site` and the CRAN environmental variable is set to the date pinned version associated with the R version in the image. For example, `https://p3m.dev/cran/__linux__/jammy/2024-10-30`.

To set a different repo, edit `${R_HOME}/etc/Rprofile.site` if you are changing an image or `~/.Rprofile` if setting user defaults:
```markdown
options(repos = c(CRAN = 'https://p3m.dev/cran/__linux__/jammy/latest'), download.file.method = 'libcurl')
```
You can also specify the repo to use in `install.packages()` like so
```markdown
repo <- "https://p3m.dev/cran/__linux__/jammy/latest"
list.of.packages <- c("maps", "mapdata", "RColorBrewer")
install.packages(list.of.packages, repos=repo)
```
