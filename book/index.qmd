# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The py-rocket-base image is a base image for JupyterHubs with Jupyter Lab, RStudio, Desktop, and VSCode UIs. What makes py-rocket-base unique, is that the RStudio UI (via `/rstudio`) is a R and RStudio environment installed with Rocker installation scripts[^1]. Thus all the Rocker design choices and R/RStudio environment choices are in that UI. Properly setting up environments to work properly with spatial libraries and HPC libraries is tricky. py-rocket-base solves this problem (and the associated maintenance of installation scripts) by using Rocker installation scripts. 

The base image has the following support:

* Python + JupyterLab with mamba handling package installation and repo2docker (Pangeo) environment design
* R + RStudio with the Rocker environment design and Rocker scripts and other functions included
* Desktop UI for serving applications, including Java-based applications
* VSCode UI
* Quarto, Myst and Texlive installed with tlmgr for tex package management
