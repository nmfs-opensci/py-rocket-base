# Publishing

py-rocket-base has a number of packages to help with creation of documentation, books and webpages from content: Sphinx, Quarto, and Myst. Pandoc is installed which allows output to many different formats including html, Word, markdown and PDF. TexLive (for PDF output) is installed with tlmgr to handle package installation.

## Quarto

![](assets/quarto-illustration.png)

Quarto is a full-feature platform for creation of documents, books and webpages in a variety of formats. Explore the documentation at [https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/). You can use Quarto in JupyterLab, RStudio or VSCode. RStudio has the most featured integration followed by VSCode. JupyterLab integration is somewhat minimal.

### RStudio

Quarto is fully integrated with RStudio. Use the Render and Build buttons.

**Special note regarding creating pdfs**

Rendering to PDF or `format: pdf` should work fine and packages will be installed on the fly. But the package installations will not persist and you will need to install them again after you restart the server.  To get the packages into the user library at `~/texmf`, you need to do this in a terminal:
```
tlmgr install soulpos pdfcomment luatex85
```
Replace the package names with the packages you need to install.

### VSCode

The VSCode Quarto extension is installed. This provides many nice features. Read about them on the Quarto [VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html) page. The extension includes keyboard shortcuts for rendering or you can render from a terminal.

### Jupyter Lab

The `jupyterlab-quarto` package is installed which allows Quarto markdown to be rendered in markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks (ipynb). But you will need to render from a terminal. Quarto render both `qmd` and `ipynb` files. Read about using Quarto with JupyterLab on this Quarto [page](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html). For example,

```markdown
quarto render --to pdf test.qmd
quarto render --to html test.ipynb
```

For PDF output when running `quarto render` in a terminal, TexLive packages will not install on the fly and you will need to do `tlmgr install packagename` for any missing package errors you get. The packages will install in `~/texmf` and will persist in the home directory.

## MyST

[MyST](https://mystmd.org/) is an Python ecosystem of tools for creating interactive scientific publications for the web or export to PDF, LaTeX and Microsoft Word. [jupyterlab-myst](https://jupyter-book.github.io/jupyterlab-myst/) extension is installed. Read more about MyST in JupyterLab [here](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-jupyter-lab-myst). The [MyST VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight) is also installed if you are editting MyST markdown in VSCode.
</div>

**Creating PDFs with Myst**

You can output to PDF like so from a terminal: `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf test.ipynb`.
However. TexLive packages will not install on the fly and you will need to do `tlmgr install packagename` for any missing package errors you get.

## Sphinx

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a commonly used package for creating documentation for Python packages.

## TexLive

</div>

py-rocket-base has Quarto and Myst installed along with pandoc and TeXLive for output to PDF. The tlmgr is used (and must be used) to manage packages.

### Installing new TexLive packages

tlmgr must be used.

* Do not use `apt-get` to install texlive packages. This will turn off tlmgr (the TeX package manager). Instead use
```markdown
tlmgr install <package>
```
* Run `tlmgr option` to make sure tlmgr is working.

By default in py-rocket-base when `tlmgr install` is run `TEXMFHOME` is used and that is set to `\home\jovyan\texmf`. This ensures that when users install texlive packages those are persistent in the user home directory.

If you want to add texlive packages in a Dockerfile that uses py-rocket-base, then you need to unset `TEXMFHOME` otherwise the package is installed in `\home` and that is unattached in a JupyterHub (typically). Here is an example of Dockerfile code.
```markdown
FROM ghcr.io/nmfs-opensci/py-rocket-base:latest

USER root
RUN unset TEXMFHOME && \
    PATH=/usr/local/texlive/bin/linux:$PATH && \
    echo "Installing texlive collections and extra packages..." && \
    tlmgr install collection-latexrecommended collection-latexextra && \
    tlmgr install \
        pdfcol \
        tcolorbox && \
    tlmgr clean --all
USER ${NB_USER}
```
