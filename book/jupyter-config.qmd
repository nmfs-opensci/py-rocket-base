# Customizing Jupyter

If you want to customize some feature of the JupyterHub or JupyterLab, you can do this by passing in `*.json` or `*.py` configuration files. 
In py-rocket-base, these are in the `jupyter_server_config.d` and `jupyter_notebook_config.d` directories in the conda notebook environment. These directories contain the json that specifies the configurations:

```
/srv/conda/envs/notebook/
└── etc/
    └── jupyter/
        └── jupyter_server_config.d/
            ├── security.json
            ├── extensions.json
            └── custom.json
        └── jupyter_notebook_config.d/
            └── custom.json
```

If you want to change these configurations, you need to either update the file with the configuration or add a new configuration file. You can add either *.json or *.py configurations files to the same directory.
